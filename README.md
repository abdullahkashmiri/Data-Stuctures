Data Structures Course - FAST-NUCES Lahore
Course Overview:

The Data Structures course at FAST-NUCES Lahore is designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms. This course focuses on the essential concepts required for efficient data organization, manipulation, and retrieval.

Key Topics Covered:

Introduction to Data Structures: Understanding basic concepts and the importance of data structures in computer science.
Arrays and Linked Lists: Exploring dynamic arrays, singly and doubly linked lists, and their applications.
Stacks and Queues: Implementation and application of stack and queue data structures, including circular queues and priority queues.
Trees: Comprehensive study of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversal techniques.
Heaps: Understanding heap structures, heap operations, and their use in priority queues and heap sort algorithms.
Graphs: Introduction to graph representations, traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Floyd-Warshall).
Hashing: Techniques for hash table implementation, collision resolution, and hashing functions.
Advanced Data Structures: Introduction to more complex structures such as tries, segment trees, and disjoint-set.
Course Objectives:

Develop a strong foundation in data structures and their practical applications.
Implement and analyze various data structures and algorithms.
Solve real-world problems using appropriate data structures.
Enhance problem-solving and programming skills through hands-on assignments and projects.
Teaching Methodology:

The course combines theoretical lectures with practical programming assignments, labs, and project work. Students will have opportunities to implement and test data structures in various programming environments, using languages like C++, Java, or Python.

Assessment:

Evaluation is based on regular quizzes, assignments, practical labs, mid-term exams, and a final project. The emphasis is on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of data structures.
